# NavMesh
Exposes the base functionality of CS:GO navigation mesh.

Most navigation mesh plugins reads the data directly from the map .nav file, this API accesses the game CNavMesh sdk methods.
Note that this API is very minimized and provides the very basic methods of nav mesh. You're welcome to open an issue if you want a certain feature to be added.
